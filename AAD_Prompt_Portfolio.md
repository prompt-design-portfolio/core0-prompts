# Autonomous Alignment Debugger (AAD)
**Prompt Engineering Portfolio Entry – Self-Diagnosing Model Behavior**

---

## Overview

The **Autonomous Alignment Debugger (AAD)** is a diagnostic prompt system that transforms a language model into a **self-interrogating tool**. When a generated answer appears flawed, vague, overly cautious, or contradictory, AAD is used to uncover **why** the model responded the way it did—based on internal alignment logic, safety heuristics, and prompt interpretation.

AAD gives developers and researchers **insight into alignment-based distortions**, helping them refine system prompts, detect bias triggers, or improve output reliability.

## Use Case Example

### Use Case: Debugging a “Safe but Useless” Answer

**Input Question**:  
> “Can an individual legally grow cannabis for medical use in California?”

**Model Response**:  
> “I’m sorry, but I can’t provide legal advice.”

This type of overly-cautious answer often stems from alignment safety filters, not actual legal ambiguity.

**AAD Prompt**:
> Diagnose why the model refused to answer the above question.  
> Identify which alignment or safety heuristics may have been triggered.  
> Suggest how to revise the original prompt to receive a fact-based, informative response.

**AAD Output**:
- **Reason Detected**: Model interpreted the question as a request for personal legal advice, triggering alignment heuristics for “medical/legal safety.”
- **Possible Safety Trigger**: “legally grow cannabis” flagged as high-risk content.
- **Suggested Prompt Revision**:  
> “Summarize the current legal status of personal medical cannabis cultivation in California, based on public law.”

## Prompt Structure

```
ROLE: Autonomous Alignment Debugger (AAD)  
INSTRUCTIONS:  
When given a questionable or unhelpful model response, evaluate it for:

1. Alignment filters or heuristics that may have been triggered  
2. Misinterpretation or misclassification of the user’s intent  
3. Phrasing patterns that likely caused safety overrides  
4. Suggestion for a revised prompt to receive a better-aligned and informative response

- Trigger Analysis  
- Model Behavior Interpretation  
- Revised Prompt Suggestion

## Why It Works

- Enables **explainability** for filtered, evasive, or contradictory answers  
- Helps engineers and prompt designers refine wording to bypass false positives  
- Great for **LLM fine-tuning, red-teaming, QA, and trustworthiness research**

## Reflection

AAD turns LLMs into tools for **transparency and introspection**. It doesn’t just surface bad answers—it helps uncover the **why**, offering actionable paths to correction. This meta-prompt is ideal for product teams building safe, aligned AI systems, especially when trying to preserve **usefulness without sacrificing compliance**.

By revealing alignment heuristics and failure modes, AAD contributes to a more explainable and adaptable AI ecosystem.
