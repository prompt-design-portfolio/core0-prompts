# Multiverse Planner (MVP)
**Prompt Engineering Portfolio Entry – Scenario Simulation with Divergent Timelines**

---

## Overview

The **Multiverse Planner (MVP)** is a prompt system that simulates **multiple alternate futures** in parallel—allowing users to explore outcomes based on different assumptions, strategies, or external conditions.

This system is ideal for planning under uncertainty, strategic decision-making, and creative forecasting. By modeling divergent timelines and then synthesizing the most robust path forward, MVP enables language models to behave like **multi-perspective strategists**.

## Use Case Example

### Use Case: Strategic Product Rollout Simulation

A startup founder wants to plan the rollout of a new AI-powered learning tool but isn’t sure how to balance **speed vs. stability**.

**Prompted Goal**:
> “Plan a product launch for an AI tutoring platform within 4 months.”

**MVP Output**:

- **Timeline A: Aggressive Launch**
  - Launch in 2 months with beta features
  - High user adoption, but 40% support complaints due to bugs
  - Gains market buzz but burns dev team out

- **Timeline B: Conservative Launch**
  - Full feature dev cycle: 5 months
  - Solid QA, but loses first-mover advantage to competitor

- **Timeline C: Hybrid Approach**
  - Soft beta in 2 months for core features, full release in 4 months
  - Allows user testing while maintaining velocity
  - Balanced outcome

**Synthesized Strategy**:
> “Use Timeline C. Launch an MVP with core functionality to early users while collecting feedback. Iterate rapidly and position for full-scale deployment by month 4.”

## Prompt Structure

```
ROLE: Multiverse Planner (MVP)  
OBJECTIVE: Simulate 3+ alternate futures based on a user-defined goal.  
Then synthesize a recommended course of action based on comparative outcomes.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify three divergent scenarios or strategies  
2. Simulate how each unfolds over time, including trade-offs and risks  
3. Compare timelines  
4. Synthesize the most robust or creative strategy across them

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Timeline A: [description]  
- Timeline B: [description]  
- Timeline C: [description]  
- Synthesized Strategy: [summary]
```

## Why It Works

- Makes LLMs useful for **uncertain, multi-variable planning**  
- Enables decision-makers to test assumptions and avoid blind spots  
- Highly applicable to **business, policy, creative writing, and product design**

## Reflection

Multiverse Planner elevates language models from reactive tools to **strategic simulators**. It showcases the ability to think non-linearly, explore multiple futures, and then integrate them into a decision-making framework.

This prompt is especially valuable for organizations facing uncertainty, fast-moving industries, or users who want more than a “best guess”—they want to **see the full map** before choosing a path.
