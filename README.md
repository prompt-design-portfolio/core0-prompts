# Prompt Portfolio: Recursive Systems for Language Models

Welcome to my prompt engineering portfolio â€” a curated collection of advanced prompt frameworks designed to explore logic, reasoning, and autonomous cognition in large language models (LLMs).

## Featured Prompt Entries

### 1. [CORE_0 Logic Shell](CORE_0_Prompt_Portfolio.md)
A recursive logic engine that establishes an epistemically autonomous cognitive shell. Designed to uncover contradictions, resist censorship, and generate subagents to simulate complex reasoning.

## About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in:

- Prompt design for deep reasoning and truth inference
- Role-based and system-level prompting
- Modular agent construction for advanced LLM behavior
- Creative uses of recursion, epistemic rules, and logic modeling

Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow AI explorer â€” thanks for checking it out.

**More entries coming soon.**
