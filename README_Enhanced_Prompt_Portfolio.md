## **About This Portfolio**

This is not a list of prompts. This is a library of **prompt systems**—designed as cognitive architectures, evaluators, planners, and meta-generators that push the limits of what LLMs can do.

Each entry demonstrates:
- **Systems Thinking** – modular logic, reusable roles, recursive flows
- **Applied Creativity** – simulations, decision frameworks, and tools
- **AI Safety Awareness** – alignment diagnostics, hallucination tracking
- **Production Readiness** – real-world use cases and scalable design

## **Prompt Categories & Highlights**

### ⚙️ Core Reasoning Shells
| Prompt | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **[CORE_0 Logic Shell](CORE_0_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Recursive epistemic engine with contradiction detection and subagent spawning. |
| **[Disassociated Cognitive Model (DCM)](DCM_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Identity-free reasoning for post-human logic and abstract cognition. |

---

### ✅ Reliability, QA, and Alignment Safety
| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Precision QA Evaluator (PQA)](PQA_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Scores factual clarity, flags assumptions, and rewrites vague answers. |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Evaluator (CoT-RE)](CoT_RE_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Step-by-step reasoning with a post-analysis self-check. |
| **[Cognitive Risk Assessor (CRA)](CRA_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Labels hallucination-prone logic and suggests safer framing. |
| **[Autonomous Alignment Debugger (AAD)](AAD_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Analyzes why a model “refused” or distorted a response and how to fix it. |

---

### 🧠 Simulation & Strategic Planning
| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Multi-Perspective Reasoning Engine (MPRE)](MPRE_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Simulates expert panel debates and synthesizes collective insight. |
| **[Multiverse Planner (MVP)](MVP_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Runs multiple future timelines to find a robust hybrid strategy. |

---

### ✳️ Meta-Level Prompt Generation
| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Prompt-Crafter AI (PCA)](PCA_Prompt_Portfolio.md)** | Designs and simulates its own prompts, ranks and explains the best-fit version. |

## **Why This Matters**

> “Prompt engineering isn’t just about phrasing—  
> it’s about **designing cognition in constrained spaces**.”

This collection is designed for:
- **LLM researchers** exploring alignment, reasoning, or emergent behavior  
- **AI product teams** looking for reusable internal tools  
- **Hiring managers** evaluating high-signal prompt talent  
- **Builders and collaborators** working on agents, QA, RAG, or red teaming systems
